Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

(Here's an excellent online book, and this is my videos series introducing Git and GitHub.) But once you've learned the basics, it can be hard to remember which commands to use to execute the most common tasks.  I went searching for a Git reference guide that would be useful for beginners like myself, but didn't find anything ideal:  Git - the simple guide is useful as a high-level overview of the basic commands, but doesn't provide enough details. Git Cheatsheet uses a nice interactive approach to summarize a ton of git commands on one screen, but it doesn't give you any sense of workflow. Git Reference is close to what I was looking for, and links each entry to the relevant section of Pro Git (awesome!), but is too long for a quick reference. So, I decided to make my own reference guide!  The guide below is organized by task, with an emphasis on basic tasks and common command line arguments. It begins with the workflow for cloning, updating, and syncing with a remote repo because that's a common way to get started with Git and GitHub.  Note that this is only a reference guide, and will not teach you Git. It does not explain the difference between staged and committed, what to do with a .gitignore file, or when to create a branch. But if you are already familiar with those concepts, this guide will hopefully refresh your memory and help you to discover other commands you might need.  Please enjoy, and let me know your thoughts or questions in the comments!  Cloning a remote repo (that you created or forked on GitHub)  git clone < your-repo-URL >: copies your remote repo to your local machine (in a subdirectory with the repo's name), and automatically creates an \"origin\" handle git remote add upstream < forked-repo-URL >: adds an \"upstream\" handle for the repo you forked git remote -v: shows the handles for your remotes git remote show < handlename >: inspect a remote in detail Tracking, committing, and pushing your changes  git add < name >: if untracked, start tracking a file or directory; if tracked and modified, stage it for committing git reset HEAD < name >: unstage a changed file git commit -m \"message\": commits everything that has been staged with a message -a -m \"message\": automatically stages any modified files, then commits --amend -m \"new message\": fixes the message from the last commit git push origin master: pushes your commits to the master branch of the origin Syncing your local repo with the upstream repo  git fetch upstream: fetch the upstream and store its master branch in \"upstream/master\" git merge upstream/master: merge that branch into the working branch Viewing the status of your files  git status: check which files have been modified and/or staged since the last commit git diff: shows the diff for files that are modified but not staged --staged: shows the diff for files that are staged but not committed Viewing the commit history  git log: shows the detailed commit history -1: only shows the last 1 commit -p: shows the line diff for each commit -p --word-diff: shows the word diff for each commit --stat: shows stats instead of diff details --name-status: shows a simpler version of stat --oneline: just shows commit comments gitk: open a visual commit browser Managing branches  git branch: shows a list of local branches < branchname >: create a new branch with that name -d < branchname >: delete a branch -v: show the last commit on each local branch -a: show local and remote branches -va: show the last commit on each local and remote branch --merged: list which branches are already merged into the working branch (safe to delete) --no-merged: list which branches are not merged into the working branch git checkout < branchname >: switch the HEAD pointer to a different branch -b < branchname >: create a new branch and switch to it Removing, deleting, and reverting files  git rm < name >: deletes that file from the disk, then stages its deletion --cached < name >: stops tracking a file, then stages its deletion (but does not delete it from the disk) git mv < oldname > < newname >: renames the file on disk, then stages the deletion of the old name and addition of the new name git checkout -- < name >: revert a modified file on disk back to the last committed version Other basic commands  git init: initialize Git in an existing directory git config --list: shows your Git configuration touch .gitignore: create an empty .gitignore file", "about": "Gitquickreferenceforbeginners ================================= There are many good resources for learning Git.

Bots respond to users they are focused on, when active.) * User-selectable stylesheets + individual css rules (styles are editable within the CMS, individual style rules are applied after loading style, added with /set body background black) * Easy to add new commands (/addcom) (commands are stored in CMS as javascript and loaded at runtime) * All aspects and commands are listed with /help * Aspects are remembered between sessions (ie: looks the way you left it) * All aspects, documents, commands, and users have access levels * Uses Ace editor for editing documents  * DB info stored in database/config.php - run the .sql then login with admin/admin * Integrated link aggregator with full cache (fetches link with wget) * Integrated RSS feed parser and db of over 200 feeds * One aspect is called the 'metabrowser' which is an iframe that loads a URL on command (usage: /bload http://reddit.com or /meta) .. the url is also remembered between sessions. * There is an interesting JS function called 'simcom' which simulates a user typing into the command line- works for both commands and chat messages.

It is based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) with *major* config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, amazing [clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/) (further enhanced by [clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions)) and a custom prompt layout.  ![Cmder Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/g1nNf0I.png)  ## Why use it  The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, which makes it great for **USB Sticks** or **cloud storage**. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.  The Cmder's user interface is also designed to be more eye pleasing, and you can compare the main differences between Cmder and ConEmu [here](https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html).  ## Installation ### Single User Portable Config  1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/) 2. Extract the archive. *Note: This path should not be `C:\\Program Files` or anywhere else that would require Administrator access for modifying configuration files* 3. (optional) Place your own executable files into the `%cmder_root%\\bin` folder to be injected into your PATH. 4. Run `Cmder.exe`  ### Shared Cmder install with Non-Portable Individual User Config 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/) 2. Extract the archive to a shared location. 3. (optional) Place your own executable files and custom app folders into the `%cmder_root%\\bin`. See: [bin/README.md](./bin/Readme.md)    - This folder to be injected into your PATH by default.    - See `/max_depth [1-5]` in 'Command Line Arguments for `init.bat`' table to add subdirectories recursively. 4. (optional) Place your own custom app folders into the `%cmder_root%\\opt`. See: [opt/README.md](./opt/Readme.md)    - This folder will NOT be injected into your PATH so you have total control of what gets added. 5. Run `Cmder.exe` with `/C` command line argument. Example: `cmder.exe /C %userprofile%\\cmder_config`    * This will create the following directory structure if it is missing.       ```      c:\\users\\[CH JaDi Rajput]\\cmder_config      \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500bin      \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500config      \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500profile.d      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500opt      ```    - (optional) Place your own executable files and custom app folders into `%userprofile%\\cmder_config\\bin`.     - This folder to be injected into your PATH by default.     - See `/max_depth [1-5]` in 'Command Line Arguments for `init.bat`' table to add subdirectories recursively.   - (optional) Place your own custom app folders into the `%user_profile%\\cmder_config\\opt`.     - This folder will NOT be injected into your PATH so you have total control of what gets added.   * Both the shared install and the individual user config locations can contain a full set of init and profile.d scripts enabling shared config with user overrides.

Open a terminal as an Administrator 2. Navigate to the directory you have placed Cmder 3. Execute `.\\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL`    _If you get a message \"Access Denied\" ensure you are executing the command in an **Administrator** prompt._  In a file explorer window right click in or on a directory to see \"Cmder Here\" in the context menu.  ## Keyboard shortcuts  ### Tab manipulation  * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> : New tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?) * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> : Close tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> : Close tab (if pressed on empty command) * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Fast new tab: <kbd>1</kbd> - CMD, <kbd>2</kbd> - PowerShell * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to next tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to previous tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Switch to tab #Number * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Fullscreen  ### Shell  * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!) * <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> : Traversing text with as usual on Windows * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> : History search * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Mouse : Select and copy text from buffer  _(Some shortcuts are not yet documented, though they exist - please document them here)_  ## Features  ### Access to multiple shells in one window using tabs You can open multiple tabs each containing one of the following shells:  | Task                | Shell            | Description                                                                                                  | | ----                | -----            | -----------                                                                                                  | | Cmder               | `cmd.exe`        | Windows `cmd.exe` shell enhanced with Git, Git aware prompt, Clink (GNU Readline), and Aliases.              | | Cmder as Admin      | `cmd.exe`        | Administrative Windows `cmd.exe` Cmder shell.                                                                | | PowerShell          | `powershell.exe` | Windows PowerShell enhanced with Git and Git aware prompt .                                                  | | PowerShell as Admin | `powershell.exe` | Administrative Windows `powershell.exe` Cmder shell.                                                         | | Bash                | `bash.exe`       | Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows.                                                               | | Bash as Admin       | `bash.exe`       | Administrative Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows.                                                | | Mintty              | `bash.exe`       | Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows. See below for Mintty configuration differences                | | Mintty as Admin     | `bash.exe`       | Administrative Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows. See below for Mintty configuration differences |  Cmder, PowerShell, and Bash tabs all run on top of the Windows Console API and work as you might expect in Cmder with access to use ConEmu's color schemes, key bindings and other settings defined in the ConEmu Settings dialog.  \u26a0 *NOTE:* Only the full edition of Cmder comes with a pre-installed bash, using a vendored [git-for-windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installation. The pre-configured Bash tabs may not work on Cmder mini edition without additional configuration.  You may however, choose to use an external installation of bash, such as Microsoft's [Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (called WSL) or the [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) project which provides POSIX support on windows.  \u26a0 *NOTE:* Mintty tabs use a program called 'mintty' as the terminal emulator that is not based on the Windows Console API, rather it's rendered graphically by ConEmu. Mintty differs from the other tabs in that it supports xterm/xterm-256color TERM types, and does not work with ConEmu settings like color schemes and key bindings.  As such, some differences in functionality are to be expected, such as Cmder not being able to apply a system-wide configuration to it.  As a result mintty specific config is done via the `[%USERPROFILE%|$HOME]/.minttyrc` file.  You may read more about Mintty and its config file [here](https://github.com/mintty/mintty).  An example of setting Cmder portable terminal colors for mintty:  From a bash/mintty shell:  ``` cd $CMDER_ROOT/vendor git clone https://github.com/karlin/mintty-colors-solarized.git cd mintty-colors-solarized/ echo source \\$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/mintty-colors-solarized/mintty-solarized-dark.sh>>$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh ```  You may find some Monokai color schemes for mintty to match Cmder [here](https://github.com/oumu/mintty-color-schemes/blob/master/base16-monokai-mod.minttyrc).  ### Changing Cmder Default `cmd.exe` Prompt Config File  The default Cmder shell `cmd::Cmder` prompt is customized using `Clink` and is configured by editing a config file that exists in one of two locations:  - Single User Portable Config `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\cmder_prompt_config.lua` - Shared Cmder install with Non-Portable Individual User Config `%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\\cmder_prompt_config.lua`  If your Cmder setup does not have this file create it from `%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\cmder_prompt_config.lua.default`  Customizations include:  - Colors. - Single/Multi-line. - Full path/Folder only. - `[user]@[host]` to the beginning of the prompt. - `~` for home directory. - `\u03bb` symbol  Documentation is in the file for each setting.  ### Changing Cmder Default `cmd.exe` Shell Startup Behaviour Using Task Arguments  1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> 1. Click either:   * `1. {cmd::Cmder as Admin}`   * `2. {cmd::Cmder}` 1.

Edit the below files to add your own configuration:  | Shell         | Cmder Portable User Config                | | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | | Cmder         | `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`    | | PowerShell    | `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user_profile.ps1` | | Bash/Mintty   | `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh`      |  Note: Bash and Mintty sessions will also source the `$HOME/.bashrc` file if it exists after it sources `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh`.  You can write `*.cmd|*.bat`, `*.ps1`, and `*.sh` scripts and just drop them in the `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d` folder to add startup config to Cmder.  | Shell         | Cmder `Profile.d` Scripts                          | | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | | Cmder         | `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\*.bat and *.cmd`    | | PowerShell    | `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\profile.d\\*.ps1`           | | Bash/Mintty   | `$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh`                |  #### Git Status Opt-Out   To disable Cmder prompt git status globally add the following to `~/.gitconfig` or locally for a single repo `[repo]/.git/config` and start a new session.   *Note: This configuration is not portable*   ```  [cmder]    status = false      # Opt out of Git status for 'ALL' Cmder supported shells.    cmdstatus = false   # Opt out of Git status for 'Cmd.exe' shells.    psstatus = false    # Opt out of Git status for 'Powershell.exe and 'Pwsh.exe' shells.    shstatus = false    # Opt out of Git status for 'bash.exe' shells.  ```  ### Aliases #### Cmder(`Cmd.exe`) Aliases You can define simple aliases for `cmd.exe` sessions with a command like `alias name=command`.  Cmd.exe aliases support optional parameters through the `$1-9` or the `$*` special characters so the alias `vi=vim.exe $*` typed as `vi [filename]` will open `[filename]` in `vim.exe`.  Cmd.exe aliases can also be more complex. See: [DOSKEY.EXE documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/doskey) for additional details on complex aliases/macros for `cmd.exe`  Aliases defined using the `alias.bat` command will automatically be saved in the `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_aliases.cmd` file  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/init.bat`.  Anything stored in `%CMDER_ROOT%` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\*.cmd` and `\\*.bat` * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_aliases.cmd` * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`  #### Bash.exe|Mintty.exe Aliases Bash shells support simple and complex aliases with optional parameters natively so they work a little different.  Typing `alias name=command` will create an alias only for the current running session.  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh`.  Anything stored in `$CMDER_ROOT` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh` * `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh` * `$HOME/.bashrc`  If you add bash aliases to `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh` they will be portable and follow your Cmder folder if you copy it to another machine.  `$HOME/.bashrc` defined aliases are not portable.  #### PowerShell.exe Aliases PowerShell has native simple alias support, for example `[new-alias | set-alias] alias command`, so complex aliases with optional parameters are not supported in PowerShell sessions.  Type `get-help [new-alias|set-alias] -full` for help on PowerShell aliases.  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\vendor\\user_profile.ps1`.  Anything stored in `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\profile.d\\*.ps1` * `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user_profile.ps1`  ### SSH Agent  To start the vendored SSH agent simply call `start-ssh-agent`, which is in the `vendor/git-for-windows/cmd` folder.  If you want to run SSH agent on startup, include the line `@call \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd\"` in `%CMDER_ROOT%/config/user_profile.cmd` (usually just uncomment it).  ### Vendored Git  Cmder is by default shipped with a vendored Git installation.  On each instance of launching Cmder, an attempt is made to locate any other user provided Git binaries. Upon finding a `git.exe` binary, Cmder further compares its version against the vendored one _by executing_ it. The vendored `git.exe` binary is _only_ used when it is more recent than the user-installed one.  You may use your favorite version of Git by including its path in the `%PATH%` environment variable.  Moreover, the **Mini** edition of Cmder (found on the [downloads page](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases)) excludes any vendored Git binaries.  ### Using external Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, WSL, or Git for Windows SDK with Cmder.  You may run bash (the default shell used on Linux, macOS and GNU/Hurd) externally on Cmder, using the following instructions:  1. Setup a new task by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> +<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>. 1. Click the `+` button to add a task. 1. Name the new task in the top text box. 1. Provide task parameters, this is optional. 1. Add `cmd /c \"[path_to_external_env]\\bin\\bash --login -i\" -new_console` to the `Commands` text box.  **Recommended Optional Steps:**  Copy the `vendor/cmder_exinit` file to the Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, or Git for Windows SDK environments `/etc/profile.d/` folder to use portable settings in the `$CMDER_ROOT/config` folder.  Note: MinGW could work if the init scripts include `profile.d` but this has not been tested.  The destination file extension depends on the shell you use in that environment.  For example:  * bash - Copy to `/etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.sh` * zsh  - Copy to `/etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.zsh`  Uncomment and edit the below line in the script to use Cmder config even when launched from outside Cmder.  ``` # CMDER_ROOT=${USERPROFILE}/cmder  # This is not required if launched from Cmder. ```  ### Customizing user sessions using `init.bat` custom arguments.  You can pass custom arguments to `init.bat` and use `cexec.cmd` in your `user_profile.cmd` to evaluate these arguments then execute commands based on a particular flag being detected or not.  `init.bat` creates two shortcuts for using `cexec.cmd` in your profile scripts.  #### `%ccall%` - Evaluates flags, runs commands if found,  and returns to the calling script and continues.  ``` ccall=call C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd ```  Example: `%ccall% /startnotepad start notepad.exe`  #### `%cexec%` - Evaluates flags, runs commands if found, and does not return to the calling script.  ``` cexec=C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd ```  Example: `%cexec% /startnotepad start notepad.exe`  It is useful when you have multiple tasks to execute `cmder` and need it to initialize the session differently depending on the task chosen.  To conditionally start `notepad.exe` when you start a specific `cmder` task:  * Press <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> * Click `+` to add a new task. * Add the below to the `Commands` block:    ```batch    cmd.exe /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" /startnotepad\"    ```  * Add the below to your `%cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`    ```batch    %ccall% \"/startNotepad\" \"start\" \"notepad.exe\"`    ```  To see detailed usage of `cexec`, type `cexec /?` in cmder.  ### Integrating Cmder with [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper), [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and your favorite IDEs  Cmder by default comes with a vendored ConEmu installation as the underlying terminal emulator, as stated [here](https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html).  However, Cmder can in fact run in a variety of other terminal emulators, and even integrated IDEs. Assuming you have the latest version of Cmder, follow the following instructions to get Cmder working with your own terminal emulator.  For instructions on how to integrate Cmder with your IDE, please read our [Wiki section](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki#cmder-integration).  ## Upgrading  The process of upgrading Cmder depends on the version/build you are currently running.  If you have a `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`, you are running a newer version of Cmder, follow the below process:  1. Exit all Cmder sessions and relaunch `[cmder_root]/cmder.exe`, this backs up your existing `[cmder_root]/vendor/conemu-maximus5/conemu.xml` to `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`.     * The `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml` contains any custom settings you have made using the 'Setup Tasks' settings dialog.  2. Exit all Cmder sessions and backup any files you have manually edited under `[cmder_root]/vendor`.     * Editing files under `[cmder_root]/vendor` is not recommended since you will need to re-apply these changes after any upgrade.  All user customizations should go in `[cmder_root]/config` folder.  3.  Delete the `[cmder_root]/vendor` folder. 4.  Extract the new `cmder.zip` or `cmder_mini.zip` into `[cmder_root]/` overwriting all files when prompted.  If you do not have a `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`, you are running an older version of cmder, follow the below process:  1. Exit all Cmder sessions and backup `[cmder_root]/vendor/conemu-maximus5/conemu.xml` to `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`.  2. Backup any files you have manually edited under `[cmder_root]/vendor`.     * Editing files under `[cmder_root]/vendor` is not recommended since you will need to re-apply these changes after any upgrade.  All user customizations should go in `[cmder_root]/config` folder.  3.  Delete the `[cmder_root]/vendor` folder. 4.  Extract the new `cmder.zip` or `cmder_mini.zip` into `[cmder_root]/` overwriting all files when prompted.  ## Current development builds  You can download builds of the current development branch by going to AppVeyor via the following link:  [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/cmderdev/cmder?svg=True)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/branch/master/artifacts)  ## License  All software included is bundled with own license  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2016 Samuel Vasko  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
